# First name researcher

Some nodejs scripts to help me and my wife finding the less regular first names for our second child.

### Install

- run command :

``` javascript
npm install
```

## Data from lexique.org

- run command :

``` javascript
node process-data-lexique.org.js
```

will output 2 json files in data-lexique-org: female.json and male.json. We just selected first names which are french and (spanish or english).
